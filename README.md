Node.js core library source code explained in details
###
Source code is based on version 6.3.1 and commented in details. I've rewritten some part of code for more readability. Those changes are semantic, don't actually affect on functionalities. If there's any error or ambiguity, please let me know.

I recommend starting reading from the `EventEmitter` and moving to the `Stream` and it subtypes. After you fully understand `EventEmitter` and `Streams`, then move to networking or file system part. For the utility parts, like `util` or `console`, you can read whenever you want.
